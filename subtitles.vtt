00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is the McKinsey Podcast where we help you make sense out of our world's toughest

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.640
business challenges.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.800
Welcome to the show.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:17.559
I'm Lucia Raheli and I'm Roberta Fassara.

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:23.320
Middle managers, bogged down by process and administrative tasks, can get a bad rap.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.240
McKinsey talent experts Emily Field and Brian Hancock wrote the book Power to the Middle

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.039
to polish the perception and clarify the vital role of middle managers.

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.640
In the years since the book was published in Walk Generative AI and the way we work started

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.879
to change.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.439
When I spoke with Emily and Brian on our McKinsey Talks talent podcast, they said using

00:00:43.439 --> 00:00:49.159
Gen AI will free up middle managers to support their teams more effectively and might update

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.359
their image while they're at it.

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.439
Here's our conversation.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.000
Brian, Emily, welcome to the podcast.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.359
It's great to be with you.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:58.359
It's great to be here.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:03.600
So we are coming up on the one year anniversary of your book Power to the Middle.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.359
Why managers hold the keys to the future of work co-authored with our former colleague,

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:09.359
Bill Schanninger.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.079
Let's start with some context.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.079
Give us your best quick and dirty on the book's fundamental premise.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:19.079
In two words, managers matter, right?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.079
This idea that managers hold the key to the future of work.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.079
We believe that deeply.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.359
We just haven't set them up for success.

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:30.079
When you ask managers what they're spending their time doing, over half of the time is

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.159
an administrative individual contribute to work, things that aren't managerial.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.959
And when you look at who's the most burned out, what level of the organization most burned

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:41.640
out, it's managers.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.599
If you look at the evolution of the middle manager, they were once folks with stature and

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:52.079
an organization and they did seem to matter historically they had purpose.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.079
What changed?

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.000
Being a manager has never been easy, but it has gotten more complex.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.280
Part of that just from a history perspective came from the rise of email and the ability

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.079
for a CEO to rapidly communicate to all employees and managers saying, what does that mean

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.079
for me?

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.479
And so there was this question in the 90s of what do we need middle managers for?

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.919
There's a question now.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:24.639
And importantly, what we know is that managers are absolutely critical.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.359
They are the translation.

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:27.639
They are the connectors.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.519
They are the navigators and the coaches.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.280
And also their role has become more complicated.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.719
And so managers were frustrated in the 60s and 70s.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.639
Managers are still frustrated now.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:45.280
44% site organizational bureaucracy is getting in the way of being able to do their work.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.439
And then you layer on the pandemic, the great resignation, quiet quitting, social injustice,

00:02:53.439 --> 00:03:00.120
well being and burnout, generating eye and technology advancements, financial economic

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.879
pressures like, wow, the manager is stuck in the middle of this meteor shower of external

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.159
and internal forces that makes the job harder.

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:19.159
So let's stay on that AI point for a few minutes because in the time that has elapsed since

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:27.159
you published this book, Gen AI has really taken hold as a seismically disruptive force in

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.199
the business world.

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:36.400
And we have seen this relentless cost pressure on organizations and pressure on middle managers

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.000
in particular.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.439
What do you expect this time out?

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.800
I think when it comes to Gen. of AI, I think we're still in the very early stages.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.560
I think we are starting to recognize the various use cases that Gen. of AI can make.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.280
It's on recently with Stanford professor Eric Rune-Jolfson, who does a lot of thinking

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.439
about Gen. of AI.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:05.240
And he thinks of Gen. of AI as a general purpose technology, like the internet, like electricity.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.840
And if you think about the early use cases of electricity, people are like, well, it's

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.159
streetlights.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.920
We can have electric streetlights.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.319
And they're really expensive streetlights.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:22.319
And as you build more and more on top of it, you get more and more capability and pieces.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:29.040
And right now, we're a little bit at the analogous stage of Gen. of AI.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.960
Lots of belief in the promise.

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:33.680
Some use cases that we're seeing really there.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.239
But in most organizations, it's not yet at a point where a manager is like, hey, I

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:40.719
have freed up a full day a week.

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:45.959
So I think what we're seeing our managers think through is, hey, there is a promise in

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:47.359
the future.

00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:51.219
But let's see how it plays out because we've heard a lot, but we haven't necessarily

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:52.679
seen the use cases.

00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:56.719
As Emily can talk through, what we are seeing our clients is really investing heavily

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.159
in Gen. of AI to help our managers.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.560
So let me tell you the common frame that I hear from folks maybe in early days, which

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.900
is really well-intended CEOs, business executives, CHROs saying, my managers are the most

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.520
burnt out of everyone.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.120
And they matter so much.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.840
And if we're being honest, we canceled some of our manager development programs during

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:30.319
the pandemic because it was all hands on deck need to deliver safe guard also, you know,

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.359
it was unsafe to co-locate for a period of time.

00:05:33.359 --> 00:05:36.120
And so we are now going to focus on managers.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.639
And we're bringing back our first manager program.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:45.359
And because our manager, they're so burnt out, we're going to send them to a retreat for

00:05:45.359 --> 00:05:46.359
a week.

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:48.559
And that is well-intended, right?

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:56.000
But the idea of sending managers away for a week to do leadership development when they

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.399
are burnt out, when the work is not going to stop, when they are, some of them are so stressed

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:04.600
out that they are in the red zone, not the learning zone, right?

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.680
They're cortisol through the roof.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:14.079
This idea that we're going to send people away and develop them frankly is not the best

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:16.120
use of resources.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.000
We need to think about developing managers is not just a learning program.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.759
Learning training development has a role, but it is a part of a broader manager operating

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.120
system.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.680
And so first and foremost, when I'm talking to business leaders, my strong suggestion

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:43.680
is before you send your managers to a leadership development programmer of retreat, first create

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.639
space.

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.680
Which create time in their day.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:55.159
What are they doing today that you can kill, automate, delegate down, streamline?

00:06:55.159 --> 00:07:02.120
Then once you've created some space in the system, how do you build some resiliency habits

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.839
for your managers?

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:11.560
How do you help them manage this inherent stress that we set is increasing with being a manager?

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.319
How do we help them put on their own oxygen mask before they're able to help others,

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:18.319
their teams?

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:25.879
And then when you freed up time and space and you've built resilient, adaptable leaders,

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:28.879
then you can say what is the leadership development program?

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:36.160
And then perhaps the thing that is most important, but often forgotten by, again, well-intended

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.800
business leaders that say I've got to invest in my managers is the key question every

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.000
business leader needs to ask themself.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:53.400
Which is what do I, what does my leadership team need to do differently to support our

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.520
managers?

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.120
If we say we want to empower managers, are we setting them up for success?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.720
Or if we're being honest, are we talking the talk, but not walking the walk?

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.200
And so leaders need to also change.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:15.000
We see in the headlines again and again that middle managers are under pressure, are

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.720
getting cut particularly in tech organizations.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.360
Are you finding that within this particular pressured environment clients are receptive

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.560
to making the time for middle managers?

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.919
I think they are because I think what they recognize is that it's not to say that there

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.639
aren't efficiencies that can be gained at every level of an organization.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:44.559
There, if we streamline decision-making, if we make accountability is clear, if we leverage

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:51.039
technologies in new ways, it recreates the way work gets done at every level of the organization.

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:55.000
And so I think what we're seeing our clients think through is, hey, let's think through

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.759
holistically how work needs to get done differently.

00:08:57.759 --> 00:08:59.919
What's the role of the management of the future?

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:06.439
And then how do we craft to that role in a way that provides them time to do what managers

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:07.439
can do best?

00:09:07.439 --> 00:09:12.240
And in some organizations that may be a reduction in the overall number of managers, but

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:18.479
done in a way that actually frees up and creates more capacity for coaching, more capacity

00:09:18.479 --> 00:09:20.279
for the things that matter most.

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:22.639
And so we don't see it as an either work conversation.

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:26.240
We see it as a way of saying, hey, our organization isn't working.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:31.200
And the ways it's not working includes, it may not be in the cost position we need it.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.680
We may not have the coaching development.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.960
We have those things often go together.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.600
And so how do we comprehensively think about work?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:44.560
How do we think about management practices in the context of work and how do we change

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:49.639
it so that we're getting perhaps a more efficient organization, but also one that is more

00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:52.680
effective, particularly at the managerial layer?

00:09:52.679 --> 00:09:53.679
Really agree, Brian.

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:58.559
And also go back a year ago right before the book came out.

00:09:58.559 --> 00:10:03.959
And there were some very prominent tech leaders questioning publicly, do we even need middle

00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:04.959
managers?

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:07.759
And that's really great clickbait, right?

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:10.959
But the reality is, yes, we absolutely do.

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:17.799
Managers are consistently on the top three list of many of the CEOs that I talked to.

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:23.079
Now what's really important too is to Brian's point on business performance is we also

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:25.719
haven't set managers up for success.

00:10:25.719 --> 00:10:32.799
And then the other piece is that too many managers, not all, that many are not set up for

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.719
their best purpose.

00:10:34.719 --> 00:10:36.559
And so there are different types of managers.

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:43.639
We often talk about managers as a, you know, one common group, right?

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:46.960
There are managers that are player coaches.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.279
They have smaller spans of control, three to five.

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:57.000
And they have some individual contributor work that they are uniquely suited to do.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.319
Then you've got facilitators and coordinators that are able to lead more at scale.

00:11:02.319 --> 00:11:08.639
But in no situation that I described of these different types of managers, is there a situation

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:15.960
where the right answer is one manager having one director port.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.840
We often call those micro teams.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:24.519
And so this comes down to particularly in a cost pressure environment to Brian's point

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:28.360
saying, how do we set the organization up for success?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:35.799
How do you set the manager roles of which there are multiple different flavors up for success?

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:42.639
And recognize that micro teams or one Z2Z relationships are not the ones that are going

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:45.559
to set the organization up to be able to deliver.

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:51.240
As we talk about the archetypes of managers, one of the things that heartened me most after

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:57.799
the release of the book was the number of CEOs where what resonated was, yes, some of the

00:11:57.799 --> 00:12:00.079
white collar managers in the headquarters.

00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:05.159
But they saw when we're talking about power to the middle, they also saw their plant managers.

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:07.279
They saw their store managers.

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:09.159
They saw their facilities leaders.

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:16.199
They saw people that were responsible for being the leader out in the field.

00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:22.759
And when you took all of this together, they were saying, yeah, our managers are saying,

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:25.600
stop the emails coming from corporate.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.480
Stop the things that we're doing.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:32.319
Let me engage with our customers, our clients, our people.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.840
Let me figure out how to adapt what our offering is to the new things because I'm the one

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.640
position to make that happen.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.600
And they said all of the lessons of the book, we talk about lots of different types of managers,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.640
but they say it really comes to life for them in some of those distributed field management

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.640
roles.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:52.560
And I thought that was pretty interesting.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:58.920
And if you add on to that, some of the recent press, Walmart was recently in multiple

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:02.599
different publications on their store managers.

00:13:02.599 --> 00:13:09.559
In addition to having dedicated a manager academy to lean in and coach the managers, it is

00:13:09.559 --> 00:13:16.240
now the case that a Walmart store manager can make over $500,000 a year.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.879
Wow, really?

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:22.399
A Walmart store manager can make over $500,000 a year.

00:13:22.399 --> 00:13:28.839
They can make up to 200% of their base based on the performance.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:36.519
And when other organizations see that, they're like, okay, that is a real investment behind

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:39.720
a pretty broad cohort of managers.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:44.519
And if Walmart can do it and do it at their scale, what does that mean for me?

00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:52.680
How do you think the rise of AI will affect those spans and layers that you described in

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.519
the knowledge worker setting?

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:58.960
Meaning managers will remain important.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.120
Managers are going to be the ones that they may be managing a team of people that they're

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:05.679
apprenticing that are coming up.

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:08.759
So, they'll still, managers will still need to be there.

00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:13.480
Managers will also need to kind of manage the underlying, you know, tools.

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.480
And if you want to think about, you know, some of the assistance as, you know, robotic team

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.559
members, you might think of it that way.

00:14:19.559 --> 00:14:23.399
But managers are still going to be needed to integrate information.

00:14:23.639 --> 00:14:27.720
Are still going to be needed to coach, still going to need to make things happen.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.199
So there may be some efficiencies if you take away some of the administrative work of managers.

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:38.120
But I think you'll end up replacing that administrative work with managers with the coaching

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.879
of team members, with the quality control, with the integration of pieces.

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:48.120
Because generative AI, I think it's incredibly powerful that you can give a manager insight

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.159
across all areas of the organization at their fingertips.

00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:56.319
And so what we need to do is we need to have more managers actually thinking through

00:14:56.319 --> 00:14:58.279
holistically and integrating.

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:04.399
And we may need fewer managers that are managing an individual process or an outcome or a piece.

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:07.480
You know, hey, they're the integrated problem solvers.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.480
It's interesting.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:14.319
We recently published an interview as part of our at the Edge podcast series in which

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:25.040
Reed Hoffman suggested that AI has the potential to develop soft skills, EQ and empathy.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:36.480
If that bears out, how do you see the rise of an EQ-equipped Gen AI affecting apprenticeship

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.240
and coaching?

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.880
When it that be interesting, right?

00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:45.360
Like if you think about it, we're saying managers don't have time to do everything that

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.279
they need to do.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:52.799
And we need to free them up to spend more time coaching.

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:58.399
If they could have, you know, to Brian's point on the manager co-pilot, someone, technology

00:15:58.399 --> 00:16:01.439
to share the load, I think that's a great thing.

00:16:01.439 --> 00:16:07.960
And I think I would separate out two different things on the empathy and soft skill front.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.160
One is the ability to coach on it.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.200
And I think, you know, there are, you know, we are seeing technologies that, you know,

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.800
would be able to look at the transcript of a meeting and provide coaching to somebody

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.800
in terms of the tone of the meeting, the inclusiveness that they have, would be able to look at the

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:27.400
patterns of their interactions on Slack or other collaboration tools and provide coaching

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.680
and feedback.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:35.720
Could also generate, I could also help somebody coach through a mock feedback conversation.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.879
And so you can do that.

00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:42.759
So I think there are things where these tools can help somebody improve their soft skills.

00:16:42.759 --> 00:16:51.240
I think generative AI can, on the other side, we all want to be heard and seen.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.320
And if you know it's a bot on the other end, that may be fine for voicing your frustrations

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.519
and getting through and like, okay, yeah, the bot's playing back to me, whatever.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:05.400
But you as an individual want to be heard and seen and know that you matter to an organization.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.600
And Gen AI is not going to be able to do that in and of itself.

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:14.320
You need managers to make sure people know that they matter.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:20.519
And one of the interesting things is generative AI can help managers prompt them to hear

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.200
and see their people.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.600
So it can remind somebody that their birthday is coming up or an anniversary is coming up

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:30.600
or work anniversary is coming up or that, you know, this to it like it can prompt even

00:17:30.599 --> 00:17:36.359
the hardest to manager can prompt them with information that makes them more likely

00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:41.000
to present in a way that the people in their team feel seen and heard.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.519
Brian, you invoked inclusiveness there.

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:49.319
I'm just thinking about our signature report on women in the workplace, which we publish

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:56.279
in conjunction with lean in and which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this fall.

00:17:56.279 --> 00:18:00.559
Last year we saw again this phenomenon of the broken wrong and the difficulty that women

00:18:00.559 --> 00:18:05.240
have in getting that first managerial promotion.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.480
Emily, talk to us about how diversity intersects with this middle manager research.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.839
Yeah, and you mentioned this idea of the broken run.

00:18:13.839 --> 00:18:23.599
The reality is is that that first promotion from entry level to manager is where we see

00:18:23.599 --> 00:18:28.079
fewer women getting promoted relative to men.

00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:35.359
Last year for every 100 men that got promoted, 87 women got promoted.

00:18:35.359 --> 00:18:39.919
The numbers are disheartening and then we need to dig into the why and the what do we do

00:18:39.919 --> 00:18:47.799
about it on the why what we know is that women are more likely to be promoted based on past

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:49.679
performance.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.759
Women are more likely to be promoted based on future potential.

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:57.600
So Bob is a great guy.

00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.600
Bob's in rock star.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:18:59.799
I know he's going to do great at this.

00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:05.200
I know he's never managed before, but he's awesome versus Mary.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:10.400
Well, I'm looking at Mary's track record and she's never managed anybody.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.640
So I don't know how she's going to do.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:14.640
Right?

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.160
Bob and Mary, fictional characters, but the reality is is that when promotion and decisions

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.640
are being made, this inherent bias creeps in.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.240
And because there are more men in those leadership levels, more men are making those promotion

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.600
decisions.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:36.240
We need to de bias the promotion process and we need to make sure that we have a common

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:43.519
framework, a common rubric on which we are assessing so that we we doubt that bias and

00:19:43.519 --> 00:19:47.040
we promote on a through an equal process.

00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:53.159
What has surprised you most in the response to this book over the past year?

00:19:53.159 --> 00:20:00.359
I think what what has surprised me about the response to the book is the degree to which

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:04.079
it just continues to resonate with folks.

00:20:04.079 --> 00:20:10.319
I was expecting there to be a big launch interest in the book and then things kind of

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:12.039
taper out.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:16.359
But people are continuing to find the book to say, this is holding up what I believe

00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:17.759
to be true.

00:20:17.759 --> 00:20:22.319
That managers matter that we need to spend less time on bureaucracy and more time on

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:23.319
coaching.

00:20:23.319 --> 00:20:25.279
We need to select people who are great at managing.

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:26.279
Yeah.

00:20:26.279 --> 00:20:33.119
And maybe to build on that, what's been most surprising to me is how relevant this topic

00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:35.079
is about managers.

00:20:35.079 --> 00:20:41.159
When we were writing the book and I did a lot of writing on Delta flights cross country,

00:20:41.159 --> 00:20:44.079
I in the margins of the book, right?

00:20:44.079 --> 00:20:45.279
It takes a while to write a book.

00:20:45.279 --> 00:20:52.000
So I'm writing this 2021-22 when I'm writing in the margins, check for relevance for July

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.279
2023.

00:20:54.279 --> 00:20:59.559
Thinking to myself, some of the questions on flexible and remote work, on burnout and

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:04.519
well-being, on the great resignation and quiet quitting, like, oh, surely we'll have figured

00:21:04.519 --> 00:21:05.519
it out.

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:08.480
And by the time the book comes out, we're actually going to have to update it because it's not

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.879
going to be relevant anymore.

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:17.120
And the reality is, is that the book still resonates to other thoughts just in terms

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:23.080
of what surprised me is the deep engagement of readers in the book.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:29.160
And having conversations, I was recently with a group of 50 executives from a company.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:31.920
And they actually, it was their book club book.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:35.680
And they're talking about Rachel and Sonyan.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.320
Like, well, that's chapter nine.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.320
You win deep.

00:21:38.319 --> 00:21:41.879
So just tons of really deep engagement.

00:21:41.879 --> 00:21:46.439
And then finally, what I'd say, and this was part of our intention in writing the book

00:21:46.439 --> 00:21:52.720
to Brian's point of people wanting to be seen, people telling us, I see myself in those

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.720
stories.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.799
I deeply empathize with those experiences.

00:21:58.799 --> 00:22:00.359
They are my own.

00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:07.879
And the way that the book has been a point of validation and a place to, you know, a sort

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.960
of long pad to think through, reflect for managers.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.880
That's why we dedicated the book to them.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:20.120
And personally, I am thrilled that it's serving that purpose.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.320
Amazing.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:29.520
What is your best advice to leaders as they continue to navigate various kinds of disruptions

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.320
and change in thinking about the role of middle managers?

00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:36.879
I would have three pieces of advice.

00:22:36.879 --> 00:22:44.599
One, think about how you can create more time for our managers to spend on the, on the

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:47.759
most important activities, the coaching, the strategic activities.

00:22:47.759 --> 00:22:52.439
Secondly, how do we value managers for what they bring to the table?

00:22:52.439 --> 00:22:58.759
And I think that valuing managers includes defining what makes a good manager, selecting

00:22:58.759 --> 00:23:03.960
managers based on that, creating career paths that for people that want to go into management

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:04.960
great.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.039
But if somebody is a really good individual contributor, don't make them go into management.

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:10.880
And then invest in our managers.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:15.799
Invest in the things that we know are going to be important for managers to do going for

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:16.799
it.

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:17.799
Invest in their development.

00:23:17.799 --> 00:23:23.120
Invest in the critical skills that managers are going to need to inspire and connect people

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.640
to the mission on purpose, to help them in a new environment, learn how to manage their

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.960
teams in a way that's not micromanaging, but still empowering teams to do more than they

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:33.960
thought possible.

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:42.680
Let me add two, one, as leaders, ask yourself, what do I need to do differently to support

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.240
my managers?

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.519
This is not just about managers showing up differently.

00:23:49.519 --> 00:23:55.400
This is about leaders enabling it and also being held accountable.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:03.360
And then to the point of diversity, equity and inclusion, asking yourself, have I devised

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.519
my promotion process?

00:24:05.519 --> 00:24:12.600
Have I rooted out the inherent unconscious bias that exists and have I created an environment

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:20.840
in which people are being rewarded for and promoted because they are ready and great

00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:29.839
to be managers and not because of some historical or outdated system of what is rewarded?

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:32.839
Brian and Emily, thanks so much for joining us today.
